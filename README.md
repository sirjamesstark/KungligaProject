# KungligaProjekt
Top Secret

This project aims to develop a 2D computer game using the C programming language and the SDL2 library. The game will be a multiplayer network-based game with a client-server architecture. The goal is to allow up to four players to join and control their own characters in a competitive environment, engaging in battles on a shared platform.

The project will follow agile methodologies, specifically the Scrum framework, with weekly sprint planning to guide the development process. At the end of each sprint, a prototype of the game will be produced, and the work will be reviewed by the stakeholders.

Goals:

The game will be developed using SDL2, with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to interact and control their characters.
The game will allow up to four players to play together via network communication.
The game will feature a playable environment where players control characters to overcome various obstacles and engage in combat.
In-game events (clicks, movements, etc.) and visuals will be managed using SDL2's tools.
Technologies:

Programming Language: C
Game Library: SDL2
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Project Management: Taiga (Scrum Framework)
At the end of the project, a working prototype of the game will be delivered, where up to four players can interact with each other through the network, featuring functional game mechanics and engaging visuals. Additionally, regular retrospective meetings will be held throughout the project to continuously improve team collaboration and development processes.

Sincerely,

Current Scrum Master - Sir James Stark
